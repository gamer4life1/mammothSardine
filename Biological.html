      <h3>The Little Brown Bat</h3>
      <img src="images/journal.pone.0113958.g004.png" alt="" width="400" height="400" class="cards"/>
      <h4>Physical Appearance</h4>
	  <p>The little brown bat’s fur is dark brown on the back and upper parts with greyish fur underneath. Their wing membranes are dark brown on a typical wingspan of 22–27 cm. Their ears are small and black with a short, rounded tragus (little bump on your ear). Adult bats are typically 6–10 cm (2.4–3.9 in) long and weigh 5–14 grams (0.2–0.5 oz). Females are usually bigger than males. The bat has 38 teeth which are all (including molars) relatively sharp, as usual for an insectivore, and canines are important to enable grasping insects in flight. There are large numbers of little brown bats inside the caves of Mammoth Cave National Park.</p>

	  <h4>Methods of survival</h4>
	  <p>The little brown bat lives in three different roosting (resting) sites: day roosts, night roosts, and hibernation roosts. The locations chosen for roosts have stable temperatures. Day and night roosts include, but are not limited to, buildings, trees, under rocks, and in piles of wood. Day roosts have very little or no light, they provide good shelter, and usually have southwestern sunlight exposures to provide heat for awakening from daily torpor (a kind of sleep). Night roosts are chosen because of their confined spaces where large groups of bats can stay together to increase the temperature in the roost. These roosts are mainly occupied when temperatures are below 15°C (59°F). Night roosts are usually far from day roosts; this may lower the gathering of excrements at day roosts and avoid signaling predators. Day and night roosts are used during spring, summer, and fall months, but during the winter, hibernation sites are used. These sites usually include abandoned mines or caves where the temperature is always above freezing and humidity is high. The caves of National Park provide excellent hibernation sites for a few thousand bats.</p>
	  <h4>White-nose syndrome</h4>
	  <p>White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease that affects hibernating bats and is caused by a fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, or Pd for short. Sometimes Pd looks like a white fuzz on bats’ faces, which is how the disease got its name. Pd grows in cold, dark and damp places. It attacks the bare skin of bats while they’re hibernating in a relatively inactive state. The bats, in response, wake up and use up the fat that was critical to their survival in hibernation. The bats try to find food, but they find nothing, because it’s winter. Then, having no more energy, they die from starvation. This is primarily a problem for little brown bats and the long-eared bat, who have less resistance to the white-nose syndrome than other bats, like the large brown bat.</p>

		<p>Here is a chart showing the spread of WNS:</p>
		<img src="images/wnsmap2017.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" class="cards" />
		<p>White-nose syndrome has killed millions of bats in North America. At some places, 90 to 100 percent of bats have died. A possible reason of how the disease spreads is because of the visitors touching the caves, infecting other caves. Then, the infected bats fly to other roosts and infect others, and so on. </p> 
		<p>There is no cure for white-nose syndrome, but scientists from all over the world are working together to study the disease, how it spreads and infects bats and what we can do to control it. Several experimental treatments, including a vaccine and making changes to bat habitats and their roosts, are in progress and will hopefully lead to the increased survival of bats. </p>

      <h3>The Tulip Poplar Tree</h3>
      <img src="images/e94f1df032d3d6b0a3814fc6ac1eb8a9--ecological-succession-permaculture.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <h4>Physical Appearance</h4>
		<p>Liriodendron tulipifera—known as the tulip tree, American tulip tree, tulipwood, tulip poplar and yellow-poplar—is the North American version of the two-species genus (above family and under species) Liriodendron, and the tallest eastern hardwood. It is native to eastern North America, and is Kentucky’s state tree. It is fast-growing, and it does not have the common problems of weak wood strength and short lifespan usually observed in fast-growing species. April marks the start of the flowering period in Kentucky and the rest of the southern USA. The flowers are pale green or yellow (rarely white), with an orange band on the petals and they contain large quantities of nectar.</p>
		<img src="images/tulip-poplar-tree-in-flower--liriodendron-tulipifera-carol-senske.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards" />
		<h4>Adaptation</h4>
		<p>The tulip poplar is one of the first trees to grow in a forest ecosystem. It may reach 300 years of age on deep, rich, well-drained soils of forest coves (small sheltered area) and lower mountain slopes. The tulip poplar is stronger than most softwood trees, including spruce, pine, and fir. Tulip trees produce seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. A wing is attached to each seed to carry it away from the tree. Tulip tree flowers produce large amounts of nectar, which is an adaptation for attracting insect pollinators. Also, since the tree is a fast grower, it can reach light faster than other trees or plants. It has a high photosynthesis rate, which means that it can store more glucose faster. All those traits make the tulip poplar one of the dominant tree species inside Mammoth Cave National Park.</p>
		<h4>Uses</h4>
		<p>The tulip poplar tree is used for many things. It becomes construction lumber; moldings, plywood cores, drawer sides, matches, piano and organ actions, containers, paper, woodenware, furniture parts, and even caskets. Lumber cut from tulip poplar trees may be used for diverse wood-based projects such as flooring, siding, furniture and fencing. It is among the most economical and inexpensive of all domestic hardwoods. However, it is often used for interior structure and not for the outside. The root of the tree is used as a lemon-like flavoring in spruce beer, a beverage based on the tree buds originated by Northern Native Americans. It serves to ease the bitterness of the spruce beer.</p>
