    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Mammoth Cave was not one of the first national parks. Other areas like Yellowstone were declared before Mammoth Cave. The agency in charge of that was the Department of the Interior. In Dr. Croghan’s will, he decreed that the area be kept in its natural state. That made people think that Mammoth Cave should be a national park as well. The Department of Interior had the same idea, and started buying all the land inside and near Mammoth Cave.  </p>
    <p class="text_column">As for the people already living there, the department started buying their property and forcing them to move out of the area. All traces of human civilization were erased. The CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) was created and it maintained the natural state of the land. The minimum acreage was acquired by July 1, 1941, and the lands were then declared a national park.</p>
    <p class="text_column">However, the Great Onyx Cave and Crystal Cave areas, located inside the minimum land, were too expensive for the National Park Service. Those areas were added to Mammoth Cave National Park 20 years later. The park was finally dedicated as the 26th unit of the National Park Service after the end of World War Ⅱ, on September 18, 1946. </p>
